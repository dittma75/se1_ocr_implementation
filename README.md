This project was my Software Engineering project for my group's client Chu Yao of the FAA.
I contributed the regular expression parsing components, some of the image parsing components,
and the components that translated an airport diagram into a text representation as well as
an image representation (using Apache PDFBox and Xpdf pdftotext).
