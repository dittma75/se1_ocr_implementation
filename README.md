This project was a Software Engineering project proposed by Chu Yao of the Federal
Aviation Administration.  Our team leader was Joseph Kvedaras, and members of the team included
Jeffrey Koellner, James O'Donnell, Gregory Richards, Scott Ritchie, and myself, Kevin Dittmar.
I contributed the regular expression based textual data parsing components, some of the image
parsing components, and the component that converted Cartesian pixel coordinates into latitude
and longitude coordinates using the scale provided on the airport diagrams.  I also contributed
the components that translated an airport diagram into a text representation as well as an image
representation (using Apache PDFBox and Xpdf pdftotext).
